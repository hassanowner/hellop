Ever since I was little, I've had a really strong interest in motors, how they work, and how to improve them, probably because my father has a motorcycle store. I've been monitoring the store's growth for a long time, so when I discovered this art contest, I imediately knew what to do: recreate a four-stroke motor with a transmission system. Actually, this is my first time competing, so I hope you enjoy the animation!
